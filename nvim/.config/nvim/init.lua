Kickstart Guide:

  Run AND READ `:help`.
    This will open up a help window with some basic information
    about reading, navigating and searching the builtin help documentation.

    This should be the first place you go to look when you're stuck or confused
    with something. It's one of my favorite Neovim features.

    MOST IMPORTANTLY, we provide a keymap "<space>sh" to [s]earch the [h]elp documentation,
    which is very useful when you're not exactly sure of what you're looking for.

  I have left several `:help X` comments throughout the init.lua
    These are hints about where to find more information about the relevant settings,
    plugins or Neovim features used in Kickstart.

   NOTE: Look for lines like this

    Throughout the file. These are for you, the reader, to help you understand what is happening.
    Feel free to delete them once you know what you're doing, but they should serve as a guide
    for when you are first encountering a few different constructs in your Neovim config.

If you experience any errors while trying to install kickstart, run `:checkhealth` for more info.

I hope you enjoy your Neovim journey,
- TJ

-- [[ Configure and install plugins ]]
--
--  To check the current status of your plugins, run
--    :Lazy
--
--  You can press `?` in this menu for help. Use `:q` to close the window
--
--  To update plugins you can run
--    :Lazy update
--
-- NOTE: Here is where you install your plugins.

require("lazy").setup({
	-- NOTE: Plugins can be added with a link (or for a github repo: 'owner/repo' link).
	"tpope/vim-sleuth", -- Detect tabstop and shiftwidth automatically

	-- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
	-- with the first argument being the link and the following
	-- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
	--
	-- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
	--

	-- Here is a more advanced example where we pass configuration
	-- options to `gitsigns.nvim`. This is equivalent to the following Lua:
	--    require('gitsigns').setup({ ... })
	--
	-- See `:help gitsigns` to understand what the configuration keys do
	{ -- Adds git related signs to the gutter, as well as utilities for managing changes
		"lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim",
		opts = {
			signs = {
				add = { text = "+" },
				change = { text = "~" },
				delete = { text = "_" },
				topdelete = { text = "‚Äæ" },
				changedelete = { text = "~" },
			},
		},
	},

	-- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
	--
	-- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
	-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
	--
	-- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
	--  event = 'VimEnter'
	--
	-- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
	-- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
	--
	-- Then, because we use the `opts` key (recommended), the configuration runs
	-- after the plugin has been loaded as `require(MODULE).setup(opts)`.

	{ -- Useful plugin to show you pending keybinds.
		"folke/which-key.nvim",
		event = "VimEnter", -- Sets the loading event to 'VimEnter'
		opts = {

	-- The following comments only work if you have downloaded the kickstart repo, not just copy pasted the

	-- place them in the correct locations.

	-- NOTE: Next step on your Neovim journey: Add/Configure additional plugins for Kickstart
	--
	--  Here are some example plugins that I've included in the Kickstart repository.
	--  Uncomment any of the lines below to enable them (you will need to restart nvim).
	--
	-- require 'kickstart.plugins.debug',
	-- require 'kickstart.plugins.indent_line',
	-- require 'kickstart.plugins.lint',
	-- require 'kickstart.plugins.autopairs',
	-- require 'kickstart.plugins.neo-tree',
	-- require 'kickstart.plugins.gitsigns', -- adds gitsigns recommend keymaps

	-- NOTE: The import below can automatically add your own plugins, configuration, etc from `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua`
	--    This is the easiest way to modularize your config.
	--
	--  Uncomment the following line and add your plugins to `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua` to get going.
	--
	{ import = "plugins" },
	--
	-- For additional information with loading, sourcing and examples see `:help lazy.nvim-üîå-plugin-spec`
	-- Or use telescope!
	-- In normal mode type `<space>sh` then write `lazy.nvim-plugin`
	-- you can continue same window with `<space>sr` which resumes last telescope search
